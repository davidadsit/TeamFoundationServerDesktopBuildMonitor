This project was started to address some of the limitations of TFS Build Notification system tray tool.

Specifically, this build monitor adds the ability to play audio files and control certain types of home automation equipment (think lava lamps :)

It's pretty rough right now, but it works.

When configuring the TFS Server, be sure to use the full path, i.e. http://mytfsserver.mydomain.com:8080/
